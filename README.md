# NS_data_Science
Find relative position of NS particles from fracture surface

The uses FEA analysis training data set that was geneerated for particles embedded at various depths. These are fitting to a generalized normal distribution (GND) labeled as GND files excel files in the folder.

Various modulus and height data are also provided for the same section of an AFM image, labeled accordingly

The python script is scripted in the main file
